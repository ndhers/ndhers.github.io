			<h1>FEA Project</h1>
				Design and Load analysis (2018): Design of 2D structural bracket for a specific stiffness, while minimizing weight. Use of FEA software ABAQUS to determine stresses and strains on part under specified loading (picture above shows early designing phase and stresses on the part). CAD of final part and machining. Finally, the part was tested and results of stiffness and fracture were compared to predictions.
