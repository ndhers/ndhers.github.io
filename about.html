					<h1> Hi! Thank you for visiting my site.</h1>
					<h2> A little bit about myself...</h2>
					<p>I come from a small town just north of Paris in France called Saint-Witz. During my first ten years, you would most likely find me in the backyard of our house, kicking a soccer ball around as I pictured myself scoring the winning goal for my favourite team. It was not until our move to Paris as I approached my 11th birthday that I (thankfully) extended my attention to non-soccer disciplines. </p>


					<p> Quite early, I enjoyed doing math. I liked the logic of it and its inherent unequivocal nature: it's either true or false, there is no middle ground. In High School in New York, and following a year-long project on Mars colonization, I also took an active interest in space exploration (honorable mention to Hollywood movies Interstellar and The Martian for inspiring me). I wanted to become a mechanical engineer to study mathematical applications in aerospace. Having now graduated from McGill University, I hope to pursue my interests in fundamental mathematics and aerospace by completing a Master's degree. I would like to deepen my knowledge of computational mathematics to be able to design and optimize aerospace systems of the next decades.
					</p>

					<p>On this site, you will find snapshots of some of the projects I have worked on. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to chat by clicking below.</p>
